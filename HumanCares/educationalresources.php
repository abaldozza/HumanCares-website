                <h3>What is climate change?</h3>
                <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions.</p>

                <h3>Causes and effects of climate change</h3>
                <p>Fossil fuels – coal, oil and gas – are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 per cent of all carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

                <p>Scientific information taken from natural sources (such as ice cores, rocks, and tree rings) and from modern equipment (like satellites and instruments) all show the signs of a changing climate.</p>

                <h3>climate indicators</h3>
                <p>Since the Industrial Revolution, human activity has led to the emission of a considerable amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane have been blamed for the global warming phenomenon, an essential aspect of climate change.</p>

                <h3>are we adapting to climate change?</h3>
                <p>Human systems will have to adapt to climate change. Understanding of the magnitude of the adaptation challenge at a global scale, however, is incomplete, constrained by a limited understanding of if and how adaptation is taking place. </p>

                <h3>Climate change and the ecologist</h3>
                <p>The evidence for rapid climate change now seems overwhelming. Global temperatures are predicted to rise by up to 4 °C by 2100, with associated alterations in precipitation patterns.</p>

                <h3>The place on Earth heating fastest </h3>
                <p>Svalbard in the Arctic Circle is estimated to be heating at six times the global average. The consensus is that the temperature in Svalbard has jumped 4C in the past 50 years.</p>

                <h3>modern global climate change</h3>
                <p>Modern climate change is dominated by human influences, which are now large enough to exceed the bounds of natural variability. The main source of global climate change is human-induced changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

                <p>Despite it being the most studied and arguably most profound of global environmental change problems, there is relatively little research that explores climate change as a security issue.</p>
